## üì¶ Installation

### macOS/Linux

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.godeploy.app/now.sh | bash
```

### Manual Installation

Download the latest binary from our [releases page](https://github.com/silvabyte/godeploy/releases) and add it to your PATH.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

### 1. Sign Up

Create your GoDeploy account:

```bash
godeploy auth sign-up
```

### 2. Initialize

In your project directory, create a configuration file:

```bash
godeploy init
```

This creates a `godeploy.config.json` file:

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "yourAppName",
      "source_dir": "dist",
      "description": "Your application description",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Build Your App

Build your SPA using your framework's build command:

```bash
# React/Vue/Angular
npm run build

# Or your framework's build command
```

### 4. Deploy

Deploy your application to the cloud:

```bash
godeploy deploy
```

Your app is now live at `https://yourAppName-12345.godeploy.app`! üéâ

## üìñ Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The `godeploy.config.json` file defines your deployment settings:

- `name`: Your application's name (used in the deployment URL)
- `source_dir`: The directory containing your built files (e.g., `dist`, `build`)
- `description`: A brief description of your application
- `enabled`: Whether the app should be deployed

### Multi-App Configuration

Deploy multiple SPAs from a single project:

```json
{
  "apps": [
    {
      "name": "main-app",
      "source_dir": "apps/main/dist",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "admin-panel",
      "source_dir": "apps/admin/dist",
      "enabled": true
    },
    {
      "name": "docs",
      "source_dir": "apps/docs/dist",
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```
